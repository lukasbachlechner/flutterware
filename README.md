### Code quality
To keep some load off of the pipeline, please always run 

- `flutter format .`
- `flutter analyze`
- `flutter test`

before you create a PR. To make this easier, there's a ready made pre-commit hook that does exactly that. To enable it, run 

```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh && ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```
